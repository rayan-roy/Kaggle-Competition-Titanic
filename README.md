# Kaggle-Competition-Titanic:
First data science project, learning on my own

## Framework Used:
1. Numpy
2. Pandas
3. Seaborn
4. Matplotlib
5. Scikitlearn

## Learning Outcomes:
1. Understood what Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is
2. Used various statistical methods to fill missing datasets like mean and median
3. Preprocessed data and converted categorical data into numerical for smoother analysis
4. Used Random Forrest Classifier to model prediction
5. Used Accuracy score for model validation

## Readability Fix:
Due to Github unable to format the ipynb files correct, you can click on https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/rayan-roy/Kaggle-Competition-Titanic/blob/master/learning-through-titanic-example.ipynb for proper format
